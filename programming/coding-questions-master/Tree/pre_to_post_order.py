"""

Given an array representing preorder traversal of BST, print its postorder traversal. 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N,N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N input A[i].

Output:
Postorder traversal of the given preorder traversal is printed. Otherwise 'NO' is printed.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

Example:

Input:
3
5
40 30 35 80 100
8
40 30 32 35 80 90 100 120
8
7  9 6 1 4 2 3 40

Output:
35 30 100 80 40
35 32 30 120 100 90 80 40
NO
