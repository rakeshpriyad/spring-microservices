"""

Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in range from 1 to n. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, …n} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.
Note: If you find multiple answers then print the Smallest number found.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.


Output:

Print B, the repeating number followed by A which is missing in a single line.


Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 40
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N


Example:

Input
2
2
2 2
3 
1 3 3
Output
2 1
3 2
